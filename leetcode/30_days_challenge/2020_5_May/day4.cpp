  Q: Number Complement
  Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
  The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

  Example 1:
    Input: 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation:  The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), 
                  and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

  Example 2:
    Input: 1
    Output: 0
    Explanation:  The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), 
                  and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

  Note:
    The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
    You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
    This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
