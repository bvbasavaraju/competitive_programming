# competitive_programming
This repository is going to hold the coding practices that made to learn competitive programming.

I have used C++ as a language for practicing. This repository can be used by anyone for any purpose. If anyone finds a problem/answer to the problem please feel free to create a pull request.

With this repository my goal is to:
+ Speeding up writing code snippet.
+ Learn Dynamic programming.
+ Learn algorithms used in pure computer science programming.
+ Learn the competitive programming techniques.

Any problem I solve I will put it here for references. It could be for future myself or for any one who is interested.

# My dream
Hopefully one day I will be able to solve all the problems in the leetcode's programming contest within time limit.

# My background
I am from embedded programming background and my degree is Electronics and Communication. For me, writing a code in optimized way s very very important in my field. As a embedded programmer, I usually work on connecting to devices, writing device drivers going through the development board's data sheet. My development usually deal with writing optimized code in low level. So,by profession I am very fluent in C and C++. Its been more than 11 years now.

From past 5+ years(as of now), I am writing a OPC UA stack. I have been one of the core developer of MatrikonFlexOPCUA SDK. In that I have learnt many things as a programming apart from my embedded programming skills.

Most important data structure for my profession life are,
+ Stack
+ Queue
+ LinkedList / List
+ HashTable

I should know the concepts of all of these, but I cannot use the standard library related to these data structures. If required I will have to write above data structure functionalities from scratch for handling data in my programmes. Reason is, as a embedded programmer, I will not be able to compile my code if the target board's compiler doesn't support xyz libraries.

It is great for me from the technical carrier point of view as I will know each of these has to work and I have to write that logic and make it error free.

I do have worked on very complex projects. In the recent one, I do have used standard libraries for above data structures including Maps. Its a great learning.

As a hobby, I do love learning new programming languages. By hobby I do know, Java, Android, C#, Python, batch script, perl script, VBScript, JavaScript, HTML and recently started with Rust.
But my fav programming languages are: C and C++. These 2 gives so much control to the developer!
